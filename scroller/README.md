# Scroller
Scroller is designed to draw scrolling text onto a screen, similar to the scrolling screens you find in subways and bus stops.

It will connect to all screens it is connected to and draw on them.

## Existing issues
- The text only scrolls until the end then it resets, next version will have it fully scroll.
- The more screens are hooked up the laggier/slower it becomes, this is due to the way we've handled the multi-screen situation... looking into other solutions already.

- Even on one screen the delay between each character is _waaaaay_ too slow... not really sure how to handle this, gonna jump into some online threads and get some help.
